Sounds in places: 

- I like to spend time working out. I think it is great for mental health and helps me to feel strong and happy. When I work out, I am more productive throughout the day and I feel better.   
- I like to hangout at my parents house. We don't even have to be doing anything but just being there is calming.   
- I spend a lot of time at my apartment. Even when school is not in session I like to come down here.   
- I spend a lot of time working. Whether that be at alex and andrews house or at the Pete. I like to work because its something to do and I always need money.
